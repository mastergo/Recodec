   first two titles as unique, and adds two extra levels on all headers.

:Abstract:
  This recoding library converts files between various coded character sets
  and surface encodings.  When this cannot be achieved exactly, it may get rid
  of the offending characters or fall back on approximations.  The library
  recognises or produces more than 300 different character sets and is able to
  convert files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character sets, and
  all :code:`libiconv` character sets, are supported.  The |package| program
  is a handy front-end to the library.

 *If you are impatient to get rolling and do not want to read this
 whole manual, you may first read the* `Installation`_ *section as
 needed, then directly skip into the* `Quick Tutorial`_.  *However,*
 **be well aware** *that you are about to use experimental software.
 My advice is that you quickly skim over the manual to get a feeling of
 the nature of the experiment, and also, have an idea of what kind of
 information you may find in here.*
