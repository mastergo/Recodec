TeX related charsets
====================

LaTeX macro calls
-----------------

.. :tindex LaTeX, a charset
.. :tindex ltex
.. :cindex LaTeX files
.. :cindex TeX files

This charset is available in |package| under the name :charset:`LaTeX`
and has :charset:`ltex` as an alias.  It is used for ASCII files coded to
be read by LaTeX or, in certain cases, by TeX.

Whenever you recode from another charset to :charset:`LaTeX`, beware that all
occurrences of backslashes :kbd:`\` are translated into the string
``\backslash{}``.  However, in practice, people often use backslashes in the
other charset for introducing TeX commands, compromising it: it is not pure
TeX, nor it is pure other charset.  This translation of backslashes into
``\backslash{}`` can be rather inconvenient, it may be inhibited through the
command option ``-d`` (see `Using mixed charset input`_).

GNU project documentation files
-------------------------------

.. :tindex Texinfo, a charset
.. :tindex texi
.. :tindex ti
.. :cindex Texinfo files

This charset is available in |package| under the name
:charset:`Texinfo` and has :charset:`texi` and :charset:`ti` for aliases.  It is
used by the GNU project for its documentation.  Texinfo files may be
converted into Info files by the :code:`makeinfo` program and into nice
printed manuals by the TeX system.

Even if |package| may transform other charsets to Texinfo, it may
not read Texinfo files yet.  In these times, usages are also changing
between versions of Texinfo, and |package| only partially succeeds
in correctly following these changes.  So, for now, Texinfo support in
|package| should be considered as work still in progress (!).
