Other micro-computer charsets
=============================

.. :cindex NeXT charsets

The :charset:`NeXT` charset, which used to be especially provided in
releases of |package| before 3.5, has been integrated since as one
RFC 1345 table.

Apple's Macintosh code
----------------------

.. :tindex Apple-Mac
.. :cindex Macintosh charset

This charset is available in |package| under the name :charset:`Apple-Mac`.
The shortest way of specifying it in |package| is :charset:`ap`.

The charset is aimed towards a Macintosh micro-computer from Apple.
This is an eight bit code.  The file is the data fork only.  This
charset is fairly old in |package|, its tables were produced a long
while ago by mere inspection of a printed chart of the Macintosh codes
and glyph.

.. :cindex CR surface, in Macintosh charsets

It has :charset:`CR` as its implied surface.  This means that, if
the original end of lines have to be preserved while going out of
:charset:`Apple-Mac`, they should currently be added back through the usage
of a surface on the other charset, or better, just never removed.  Here
are examples for both cases:

.. parsed-literal::

  recodec ap..l2/cr < :var:`input` > :var:`output`
  recodec ap/..l2 < :var:`input` > :var:`output`

RFC 1345 brings into |package| 2 other Macintosh charsets.  You
can discover them by using :code:`grep` over the output of ``recode
-l``::

  recodec -l | grep -i mac

.. :tindex macintosh, a charset, and its aliases
.. :tindex macintosh_ce, and its aliases
.. :tindex mac
.. :tindex macce

Charsets :charset:`macintosh` and :charset:`macintosh_ce`, as well
as their aliases :charset:`mac` and :charset:`macce` also have
:charset:`CR` as their implied surface.

There are a few discrepancies between the :charset:`Apple-Mac` charset and
the very similar RFC 1345 charset :charset:`macintosh`, which have not
been analysed yet, so the charsets are being kept separate for now.
This might change in the future, and the :charset:`Apple-Mac` charset might
disappear.  Wizards would be interested in comparing the output of these
two commands::

  recodec -vh Apple-Mac..Latin-1
  recodec -vh macintosh..Latin-1

The first command use the charset prior to RFC 1345 introduction.  Both
methods give different recodings.  These differences are annoying, the
fuzziness will have to be explained and settle down one day.

.. :cindex |package|, a Macintosh port

As a side note, some people ask if there is a Macintosh port of the
|package| program.  I'm not aware of any.  I presume that if the
tool fills a need for Macintosh users, someone will port it one of these
days?

Atari ST code
-------------

.. :tindex AtariST

This charset is available in |package| under the name
:charset:`AtariST`.

This is the character set used on the Atari ST/TT/Falcon.  This is
similar to :charset:`IBM-PC`, but differs in some details: it includes some
more accented characters, the graphic characters are mostly replaced by
Hebrew characters, and there is a true German :kbd:`sharp s` different
from Greek :kbd:`beta`.

About the end-of-line conversions: the canonical end-of-line on the
Atari is ``\r\n``, but unlike :charset:`IBM-PC`, the OS makes no difference
between text and binary input/output; it is up to the application how
to interpret the data.  In fact, most of the libraries that come with
compilers can grok both ``\r\n`` and ``\n`` as end of lines.  Many of
the users who also have access to Unix systems prefer ``\n`` to ease
porting Unix utilities.  So, for easing reversibility, |package|
tries to let ``\r`` undisturbed through recodings.
