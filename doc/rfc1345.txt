Tabular sources (RFC 1345)
==============================

.. :cindex RFC 1345
.. :cindex character mnemonics, documentation
.. :cindex :code:`chset` tools

An important part of the tabular charset knowledge in |package|
comes from RFC 1345 or, alternatively, from the :code:`chset` tools,
both maintained by Keld Simonsen.  The RFC 1345 document:

  `Character Mnemonics & Character Sets`, K. Simonsen, Request for
  Comments no. 1345, Network Working Group, June 1992.

.. :cindex deviations from RFC 1345

defines many character mnemonics and character sets.  The |package| library
implements most of RFC 1345, however:

  + It does not recognise those charsets which overload character positions:
    :charset:`dk-us` and :charset:`us-dk`.  However, see `Using mixed charset
    input`_.

    .. :tindex dk-us, not recognised by recode
    .. :tindex us-dk, not recognised by recode

  + It does not recognise those charsets which combine two characters for
    representing a third: :charset:`ANSI_X3.110-1983`,
    :charset:`ISO_6937-2-add`, :charset:`T.101-G2`, :charset:`T.61-8bit`,
    :charset:`iso-ir-90` and :charset:`videotex-suppl`.

    .. :tindex ANSI_X3.110-1983, not recognised by recode
    .. :tindex ISO_6937-2-add, not recognised by recode
    .. :tindex T.101-G2, not recognised by recode
    .. :tindex T.61-8bit, not recognised by recode
    .. :tindex iso-ir-90, not recognised by recode

  + It does not recognise 16-bits charsets: :charset:`GB_2312-80`,
    :charset:`JIS_C6226-1978`, :charset:`JIS_C6226-1983`,
    :charset:`JIS_X0212-1990` and :charset:`KS_C_5601-1987`.

    .. :tindex GB_2312-80, not recognised by recode
    .. :tindex JIS_C6226-1978, not recognised by recode
    .. :tindex JIS_X0212-1990, not recognised by recode
    .. :tindex KS_C_5601-1987, not recognised by recode

  + It interprets the charset :charset:`isoir91` as :charset:`NATS-DANO`
    (alias :charset:`iso-ir-9-1`), *not* as :charset:`JIS_C6229-1984-a` (alias
    :charset:`iso-ir-91`).  It also interprets the charset :charset:`isoir92` as
    :charset:`NATS-DANO-ADD` (alias :charset:`iso-ir-9-2`), *not* as
    :charset:`JIS_C6229-1984-b` (alias :charset:`iso-ir-92`).  It might be
    better just avoiding these two alias names.

    .. :tindex isoir91
    .. :tindex isoir92

Keld Simonsen <keld@dkuug.dk> did most of RFC 1345 himself, with some
funding from Danish Standards and Nordic standards (INSTA) project.  He
also did the character set design work, with substantial input from Olle
Jaernefors.  Keld typed in almost all of the tables, some have been
contributed.  A number of people have checked the tables in various
ways.  The RFC lists a number of people who helped.

.. :cindex |package|, and RFC 1345

Keld and the |package| maintainer have an arrangement by which any new
discovered information submitted by |package| users, about tabular charsets,
is forwarded to Keld, eventually merged into Keld's work, and only then,
reimported into |package|.  Neither the |package| program nor its library try
to compete, nor even establish themselves as an alternate or diverging
reference: RFC 1345 and its new drafts stay the genuine source for most
tabular information conveyed by |package|.  Keld has been more than
collaborative so far, so there is no reason that we act otherwise.  In a word,
|package| should be perceived as the application of external references, but
not as a reference in itself.

.. :tindex RFC1345, a charset, and its aliases
.. :tindex 1345
.. :tindex mnemonic, an alias for RFC1345 charset

Internally, RFC 1345 associates which each character an unambiguous mnemonic
of a few characters, taken from ISO 646, which is a minimal ASCII subset of 83
characters.  The charset made up by these mnemonics is available in |package|
under the name :charset:`RFC1345`.  It has :charset:`mnemonic` and
:charset:`1345` for aliases.  As implemened, this charset exactly corresponds
to :charset:`mnemonic+ascii+38`, using RFC 1345 nomenclature.  Roughly said,
ISO 646 characters represent themselves, except for the ampersand (:kbd:`&`)
which appears doubled.  A prefix of a single ampersand introduces a mnemonic.
For mnemonics using two characters, the prefix is immediately by the mnemonic.
For longer mnemonics, the prefix is followed by an underline (:kbd:`_`), the
mmemonic, and another underline.  Conversions to this charset are usually
reversible.

Currently, |package| does not offer any of the many other possible variations
of this family of representations.  They will likely be implemented in some
future version, however.
